# Printer-Queue
Simulation of Printer Queue

Description: 
  The purpose of this program is to simulate the use of a printer queue to manage the processing of printer jobs.
  The simulation will operate on a per cycle basis, each of which consist of:
    1) Creating a new printer job request: probablilty-based
    2) Placing the new printer job request into the queue: priority-based
    3) Print the pages of current active job
    4) Reposition a printer job if the cycle count reaches maximum number of cycles, to the front of the queue
